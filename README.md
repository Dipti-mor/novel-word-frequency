Project Description In this project, you'll scrape the novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen from the Project Gutenberg website (which contains a vast collection of books) using the Python package requests. You will then extract words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. Finally, you'll analyze the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk).

The techniques demonstrated here are applicable to analyzing any unstructured text data, which is a significant portion of the data encountered in the real world.

Prerequisites: To complete this project, basic needs:

Import web data into Python Work with natural language text data Before starting, it is recommended to complete these courses:

Importing Data in Python (Part 2) Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python This project is based on a screencast by DataCamp, but the text source and analysis have been adapted for uniqueness.
